# BetterRest 

This repository contains my completed Project 4 - BetterRest - from Hacking With Swift's "100 Days of SwiftUI" course. BetterRest is an application that uses machine learning to predict the optimal time for a user to go to bed, based on when they need to wake up, how much coffee they've consumed, and their desired amount of sleep.

## Features

- User inputs for wake-up time, desired amount of sleep, and coffee consumption
- Uses machine learning model (CoreML) to predict optimal bedtime

## Technologies

- SwiftUI
- CoreML

## Installation

To install and run the BetterRest app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/blairduddy/BetterRest.git

2. Open the project in Xcode by double-clicking the `BetterRest.xcodeproj` file.

3. Connect your iOS device or select a simulator, and then press the 'Run' button (or `Cmd + R`) to build and run the project.

## Usage

1. Enter your desired wake-up time using the date picker.
2. Use the steppers to specify your desired amount of sleep and daily coffee consumption.
3. The app will use a machine learning model to predict and display the optimal time for you to go to bed.
